            <h3>Introduction: Learning HTML and CSS</h3>

            <p>One recent goal that I've begun to work towards is the goal of learning more about HTML and CSS. I've always had an interest in web page formatting, and intuitively know what features and structure make a web page more intriguing and enjoyable to interact with. In High School, I would often use chrome's 'Inspect Element' feature to tweak and doctor Wikipedia pages by inserting a friend's name into historic events. However, I only had a surface level understanding of how exactly this was done. While I found it amusing, I had not put much consideration into how the webpage structured its Content and why its Typography was as it was.</p>
            <p><img alt="Example of Wikipedia Manipulation via 'Inspect Element'" src="Images/image.png" /></p>
            <p>Now, 7-8 years later I'm exploring the many facets of the HTML and CSS languages and find the process of structuring web pages and its interactions fascinating. Rather than simply manipulating HTML via 'Inspect Element', I'm learning how to create entirely new assets and structure its content. As someone with a surface level understanding of coding and programming, I was not aware of just how expansive the usage of HTML and CSS truly is. While I might still get a kick out of doctoring a Wikipedia page for the sake of getting a raised eyebrow from a friend, I now find the complexity of HTML and CSS as a critical toolset worth learning and ultimately mastering.</p>

            <p>While I’m somewhat new to the landscapes of HTML and CSS, I’ve always been intrigued by programming languages and their utility. I repaired computers during my time away from University, and during this period began to foster an understanding of how information processing and information systems function. From understanding the directories of PC operating systems, I began to rewrite and re-image PC’s at a local PC repair shop. Rather than solely replacing physical components, I was intrigued by how the logical systems worked together as a network and ‘the sum of the parts is greater than the whole’ began to take on a tangible meaning rather than simply a catchphrase. </p>

                    <td>Experience building and configuring Virtual Networks (PAN, LAN, and WAN). Programming experience in Python, HTML, and CSS.</td>
                </tr>


            </table>
            <p>Since returning to MSU to learn more about Information Science, I’ve added a few new toolsets to my arsenal such as coding in basic Python, understanding the organization and function of various network/IT infrastructure, and most importantly continue to follow a new and constantly evolving passion for IT, computer science, and end-user psychology. Its role in facilitating and empowering a new and better tomorrow is now tangible, and I hope to delve much further into IT/Networking and UX Design.</p>
